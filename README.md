Dungeon-Crawler

A cooperative multiplayer game where you can explore randomly generated dungeons with your friends, fighting off the monsters within searching for a exit point . This project is all about building the Go-powered backend that creates these unique worlds on-the-fly and handles all the real-time action.

Current Progress
The foundational world generation is complete. The backend can create unique, fully-connected dungeons with distinct entry/exit points and an initial population of monsters.
